Established in 2002 with headquarters in Washington DC, IdeaCrew is a full service IT and clinical consultancy. We offer a cadre of experienced former leaders who have served federal and state government at the highest levels. Our team has led agencies through challenging start-up phases, crisis situations, and transition to normal operations. Our IT professionals have worked side-by-side with our consultants during these challenges, and we have a unique perspective on the role that IT plays in the delivery of the core mission.
