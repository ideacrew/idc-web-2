title: State Based Marketplace
description: IdeaCrew pioneered the modular approach to developing Health
  Insurance Exchanges. At initial launch, states and the Federal Marketplace
  relied on big bang deployments. These deployments, which ran into the tens and
  even hundreds of millions of dollars, failed almost universally. Whether a
  state survived depended on how it reacted to these failures. The DC Exchange
  chose IdeaCrew to build a replacement Exchange over time, module-by-module. As
  a result, DC can lay claim to the first modular Exchange, and IdeaCrew is the
  vendor that built it.
