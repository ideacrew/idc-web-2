title: State Based Marketplace
description: IdeaCrew pioneered the modular approach to developing Health Insurance Exchanges. At initial launch, states and the Federal Marketplace relied on big bang deployments. These deployments, which ran into the tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, failed almost universally. Whether a state survived depended on how it reacted to these failures. The DC Exchange chose IdeaCrew to build a replacement Exchange over time, module-by-module. As a result, DC can lay claim to the first modular Exchange, and IdeaCrew is the vendor that built it.
