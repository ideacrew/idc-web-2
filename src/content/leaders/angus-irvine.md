Angus Irvine has 18 years of experience managing Agile development and other technology projects. He currently oversees technical delivery and operations for State-Based health insurance Exchanges—the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority (HBX), Massachusetts Health Connector, and Maine’s CoverME. Angus recently oversaw a complete re-architecture of IdeaCrew’s Exchange technology platform. The re-architecture occurred while the platform was live in production and had to be carried out without disrupting customers. Deployment of this new model has led to gains in efficiencies and reduced operations and maintenance costs for the clients. Angus has extensive experience working directly with stakeholders and agency leadership. He excels at providing strategic consulting guidance and translating business priorities into realizable technical road-maps.
